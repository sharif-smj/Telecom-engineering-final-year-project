Spectrum Congestion, Connectivity Gaps, and RF
Monitoring in Uganda (2018–Present)
Spectrum Usage Growth and Congestion in Uganda
Uganda’s  commercial  wireless  networks  have  experienced  rapid  growth  in  traffic  and  infrastructure  in
recent years, leading to concerns of spectrum congestion.  Mobile data usage has exploded:  Uganda’s
mobile internet traffic roughly doubled from 217 million GB in 2021  to 421.5 million GB in 2022 , according
to Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) reports  (published 2023). This surge reflects booming
4G  data  consumption  and  smartphone  uptake.  To  support  demand,  network  infrastructure  has
expanded  – as of March 2022 there were over 30.6 million mobile subscriptions  and 4,300+ base station
sites  active across Uganda , indicating widespread deployment of 2G/3G/4G Base Transceiver Stations
(BTS). Nevertheless, operators face spectrum licensing constraints : until recently, only limited frequency
bands  were  allocated  for  4G/5G.  UCC’s  multi-band  auction  in  2022–2023  released  new  spectrum  (e.g.
700 MHz, 800 MHz “digital dividend” bands, 2.3–3.5 GHz, etc.) to MTN and Airtel , aiming to alleviate the
crunch and enable 5G rollouts. Even so, urban areas like Kampala often see heavy spectrum utilization, with
numerous carriers and technologies overlapping. Congested bands increase interference and raise the
noise floor .
Impact  on  modulation  recognition:  Spectrum  congestion  means  wireless  receivers  encounter  more
overlapping signals and radio-frequency noise. Research in 2025 notes that the rise of end-users and
wireless services has “ intensified radio spectrum congestion ” . This directly challenges  Automatic
Modulation  Classification  (AMC)  in  cognitive  radio  systems  –  it  is  harder  to  reliably  identify  signal
modulation types amid dense interference. Cognitive radios rely on modulation sensing to dynamically
access free channels; under high congestion, misclassification can occur if signals collide. Thus, Uganda’s
congestion context underscores the need for noise-robust  AMC techniques (such as deep learning classifiers
with DAE denoising) to maintain accuracy. In fact, robust AMC is considered critical in advanced wireless
design – it is “one of the basic building blocks” of both cognitive radio receivers and electronic warfare
receivers . Improving AMC resilience to noise/interference helps cognitive spectrum management : for
example, an SDR base station with AMC+DAE could better distinguish users’ modulation schemes on a
crowded tower , or a dynamic spectrum access system could detect an empty channel despite adjacent-band
interference. In summary, Uganda’s fast-growing spectrum usage (with doubling data traffic and expanding
BTS deployments) risks congestion that complicates signal classification, motivating more sophisticated
SDR/AMC solutions.

Rural Connectivity Gaps in Uganda
Despite  overall  progress,  rural  Uganda  faces  significant  connectivity  gaps .  A  large  portion  of  the
population still lacks reliable broadband or mobile coverage  outside urban centers:
Coverage deficits:  By end of 2021, 3G mobile coverage reached 93% of the population , up from
63% in 2016, while 4G coverage reached ~79% . This means roughly 7% of Ugandans (mostly in
remote rural areas) had no access to even 3G service  as of 2021. By 2025, coverage improved
further  –  the  GSMA  reports  Uganda  achieved  over  96%  population  coverage  with  3G/4G
infrastructure . However , coverage is not universal: many sparsely populated villages still fall
outside base station range (or only have a weak 2G signal). A 2024 investment report noted that
“only  65% of Uganda  [by area] has mobile network coverage” currently, and set a goal of 95%
coverage  in  coming  years .  These  gaps  are  concentrated  in  rural  districts,  especially  in
mountainous  or  hard-to-reach  regions  (e.g.  parts  of  Karamoja,  Northern  Uganda).  UCC’s  own
assessments identified 117 sub-counties with less than 30% 3G coverage  as of 2022  – a clear
indication of underserved rural pockets.
Offline population:  Due to these coverage gaps (and other barriers like cost), a large share of
Ugandans  remain  offline.  In  2024,  an  estimated  30  million  people  in  Uganda  (≈62%  of  the
population) had no access to mobile internet . Even by 2025, only ~30% of Ugandans were
active internet users  while 70% stayed offline . The majority of the offline population resides
in rural areas. This “usage gap” persists despite infrastructure presence, pointing to issues like device
affordability,  digital  literacy,  and  network  quality.  Still,  pure  lack  of  coverage  is  a  foundational
problem for many villages – without a signal, there is no opportunity to get online.
Government and UCC initiatives:  To close the rural connectivity gap, Uganda has undertaken
several  programs.  The  National  Backbone  Infrastructure  (NBI)  project  (operational  since  late
2010s) extended over 2,400 km of fiber optic backbone across the country, linking up-country towns
and border regions to high-speed backhaul . This backbone enables telecom operators to reach
rural areas with capacity (and connect public institutions – schools, hospitals – under e-government
plans). UCC also manages a  Rural Communications Development Fund (RCDF) , now branded
UCUSAF (Universal Service Access Fund), which subsidizes telecom expansion in unprofitable rural
markets. Under the  UCUSAF Access Infrastructure Program (2022–2027) , UCC is co-funding  200
new rural cell sites  in those 117 under-covered sub-counties . The first phase (63 tower sites)
launched  in  2023  in  partnership  with  a  tower  company,  targeting  villages  with  no  signal .
Additionally, in March 2024 a consortium of European development banks lent $40 million to deploy
506 new mobile towers in rural Uganda  – a project expected to boost 4G/5G coverage in
remote communities and help reach Uganda’s 95% population coverage goal. These initiatives, along
with programs to provide solar power for rural towers and community Wi-Fi hubs, illustrate the
concerted effort to bridge the rural digital divide.
Technical conditions (low SNR & multipath):  Even where rural networks exist, they often suffer
poor signal quality . Base stations in rural Uganda typically serve large cell radii (many kilometers)
with few sites, so users at the fringes experience low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)  and intermittent
connectivity. For example, a farmer 10–15 km from the nearest tower might only get a 1-bar EDGE/
3G signal, especially during bad weather . Terrain and vegetation further attenuate signals – Uganda’s
rural landscape includes hills, forests, and scattered homesteads, which can introduce  multipath•

fading  and  shadowing.  While  open  rural  areas  have  less  dense  multipath  than  cities,  hilly  or
wooded rural areas still create signal reflections and delays  that distort the radio channel. The
combination  of  low  SNR  and  multipath  interference  leads  to  high  error  rates  and  dropped
connections for rural users. These challenging conditions are precisely where noise-robust AMC  can
aid SDR deployments: an SDR system using an  Autoencoder-based denoiser  could help clean a
weak, distorted signal from a distant rural tower , improving the accuracy of modulation classification
and decoding. In essence, the rural environment in Uganda – characterized by long-range links and
propagation impediments – underscores the need for robust modulation recognition algorithms
that perform reliably under low-SNR, fading conditions (ensuring that even faint signals can be
detected and correctly identified by cognitive radio systems).

RF Security Monitoring and Surveillance Needs
Uganda has recognized the importance of  radio frequency (RF) security monitoring  to combat illicit
transmissions  and  protect  critical  communications.  Several  cases  and  policies  highlight  the  need  for
spectrum surveillance and robust signal classification for national security:
Crackdown on illegal broadcasts:  Unauthorized use of the RF spectrum – such as pirate radio
stations, rogue telecom operators, or jamming devices – has been a persistent issue. The UCC, as
regulator , has ramped up enforcement against illegal transmitters. In late 2018, UCC  deployed an
automated spectrum monitoring system  (with remote monitoring stations in Masindi and Mbale) to
“crack  the  whip”  on  unlicensed  broadcasters .  This  system,  implemented  with  international
partners  (Central  Radio  Management  Service  of  S.  Korea),  automatically  scans  and  pinpoints
illegal radio signals . “We want to know who is out there and if they are complying,”  explained UCC’s
engineering  director ,  noting  that  remote  monitoring  stations  ensure  the  spectrum  is  well
utilized and that illegal operations and interference are minimized . By switching from ad-
hoc manual checks to continuous monitoring, UCC greatly improved its capacity to detect illicit
transmissions in real time . The motivation is both economic and safety-related: for instance,
Uganda’s  aviation,  emergency  services,  and  telecom  operators  all  rely  on  clean  spectrum,  so
catching a pirate FM station or an unlicensed two-way radio that could interfere with authorized
bands is critical. The UCC’s investment (multi-billion UGX) in spectrum monitoring infrastructure
shows a strong policy push to secure the airwaves.
Spectrum congestion & security:  UCC officials have highlighted that Uganda’s RF spectrum is
densely populated –  “100% radio coverage”  has been achieved with  over 292 licensed FM radio
stations ,  plus  20+  providers  of  voice/data  services  and  ~24  million  mobile  subscribers ,  “all
[using] a finite resource – spectrum – which needs to be managed.” . In this environment, an  illicit
transmitter  can easily cause harmful interference (e.g. a bootleg radio station overlapping an airport
frequency, or an illegal cellular repeater creating noise on a mobile network). Indeed, many local
radio interferences have been traced to stations operating outside their assigned bandwidth or on
unauthorized  frequencies .  By  mid-2023  and  2025,  UCC  intensified  crackdowns  (“Operation
against illegal broadcasters”), even obtaining High Court orders to shut down pirate radio stations
that  reappeared  repeatedly.  Security  risks:  UCC’s  legal  team  warned  in  2025  that  unlicensed6 1112

broadcasters  pose  “significant  risks  to  public  safety,  security  and  the  integrity  of  the  country’s
communications sector.”  Because these operators are unregistered, authorities have no record of
their location or technical parameters, making it hard to intervene if they air dangerous content or
interfere with emergency communications . For example, during national emergencies (e.g. a
pandemic  or  election  unrest),  the  government  relies  on  licensed  broadcasters  for  coordinated
messaging; an unregulated transmitter could spread misinformation or disrupt official signals .
This  underscores  a  national  security  need  for  robust  signal  monitoring  and  identification .
Regulators and security agencies must swiftly detect and classify rogue signals – whether it’s a
clandestine radio station, a jammer , or an unauthorized military-grade communication – and then
take action (e.g. signal jamming or physical confiscation). 
Electronic warfare preparedness:  Beyond civil spectrum management, the ability to classify and
decode  RF  signals  is  vital  for  electronic  warfare  (EW)  and  surveillance.  Uganda’s  military  and
intelligence community (like others globally) monitor the airwaves for threats such as insurgent
communications, cross-border illegal transmissions, or hostile drones’ control signals.  Automatic
Modulation Classification  is a key tool in this domain – originally developed for military SIGINT/
COMINT, AMC allows identification of a signal’s modulation and thus inference of its type (e.g.
distinguishing a military HF encrypted link from a civilian broadcast). A technical survey notes that
AMC has long been used in “military areas such as electronic warfare, surveillance and threat
analysis” .  In  modern  EW  receivers,  an  AMC  module  automatically  identifies  modulation
patterns  of  intercepted  signals,  which  helps  operators  decide  if  a  signal  is  friend,  foe,  or
interference. For Uganda and East African neighbors, regional security challenges (like counter-
terror operations in Somalia or illicit radio communications by rebel groups in DRC/South Sudan)
mean there is a tangible need for RF signal classification capabilities. Noise-robust AMC, potentially
enhanced by Deep Learning (e.g. DAE-based feature extraction), would improve the reliability of
spectrum surveillance systems  used by security agencies. For instance, an SDR-based monitoring
station on Uganda’s border could use robust AMC to detect a low-power VHF transmission used by
smugglers, even under heavy background noise. The  integration of AMC in national spectrum
monitoring  thus serves both regulatory enforcement and security intelligence. Uganda’s ongoing
efforts to modernize police and defense communications (e.g. the Uganda Police’s digital radio
upgrade to encrypted DMR in 2021) further highlight focus on controlling the RF domain . In
summary, documented crackdowns on illegal spectrum use and the stated security concerns show
that  monitoring  illicit  transmissions  is  a  national  priority .  Implementing  noise-resilient
modulation  classification  in  SDR  systems  will  enhance  Uganda’s  ability  to  detect,  classify,  and
mitigate  unauthorized  or  threatening  RF  signals  amidst  an  increasingly  crowded  spectrum
environment.
