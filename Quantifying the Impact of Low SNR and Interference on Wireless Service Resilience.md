# The Imperative for Dynamic Spectrum Enforcement in Uganda: Quantifying the Impact of Low SNR and Interference on Wireless Service Resilience

## I. Executive Summary: Strategic Mandate for Intelligent Spectrum Enforcement (AMC+DAE)

Uganda's extensive digital transformation agenda, aimed at fostering a modern and prosperous society, relies fundamentally on resilient and high-quality wireless communications. This strategic national objective, highlighted in the National Development Plan III (NDPIII) 1, faces significant technical hurdles due to widespread spectrum impurity, particularly in the commercially underserved rural areas targeted by the Uganda Communications Universal Service and Access Fund (UCUSAF).2

The regulatory environment defined by the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) requires mobile network operators (MNOs) to maintain service quality under demanding conditions, exemplified by a minimum coverage standard corresponding to a signal strength greater than $\mathbf{(-90~dBm)}$.2 Operation at this marginal threshold creates a persistent low Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) environment, making standard interference detection and classification exceedingly difficult.

This technical vulnerability highlights the critical necessity for advanced spectrum intelligence capabilities. Standard detection methods are inadequate when sophisticated Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) models, which are required for dynamic enforcement, exhibit compromised classification accuracy, achieving only an average of $\mathbf{(71.76\%)}$ even under controlled, diverse SNR conditions.3 This technical deficit directly impacts the regulator's capacity to uphold mandated Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, such as repairing $\mathbf{(95\%)}$ of all reported faults within $\mathbf{(24~hours)}$.4 The implementation of AMC coupled with Dynamic Spectrum Enforcement (DAE) is therefore not merely an operational upgrade, but a foundational requirement structurally mandated by the National Broadband Policy (NBP) goals of achieving $\mathbf{(50\%)}$ rural broadband penetration and facilitating investments in "spectrum efficient technologies and techniques".5 DAE provides the requisite mechanism to secure the national spectrum, ensuring the country's significant infrastructure investments deliver reliable, high-speed services.

## II. Technical Deficiencies: Low SNR, Interference, and Wireless Channel Impairment in Rural Uganda

The effectiveness of wireless services in Uganda is intrinsically linked to the spectral cleanliness of the environment, which is severely compromised in rural regions where signal strength is inherently low.

### A. Defining the Baseline: UCC's Minimum Signal Strength Requirements

The Uganda Communications Universal Service and Access Fund (UCUSAF) program explicitly targets areas where licensed telecommunications operators face commercial unviability.2 These areas are identified using a specific technical metric: sub-counties with less than $\mathbf{(30\%)}$ geographic 3G coverage are flagged for infrastructure development.2 By selecting areas based on low geographic coverage, the UCC implicitly acknowledges the prevalence of challenging channel conditions, confirming that these are areas where channel impairment is a defining characteristic, rather than just a lack of physical access.

The minimum signal strength threshold used by the UCC to define adequate 3G coverage is crucial for understanding the operational environment. This threshold is explicitly set at more than $\mathbf{(-90~dBm)}$.2 A signal operating near this limit is situated close to the typical receiver sensitivity and far above the ideal signal range. In a practical deployment, maintaining service quality near the $\mathbf{(-90~dBm)}$ limit means the ratio of desired signal power to interference and noise power (SINR) is perpetually marginal. This condition renders high-order modulation schemes difficult and creates an environment where low-power, unauthorized transmissions can easily cause significant interference or even masquerade as background noise. The ability of a regulatory monitoring system to accurately discern the type of signal (its modulation) under such noisy conditions is highly restricted, justifying the urgent need for advanced AMC capabilities to identify signal sources at these technical limits.

### B. Implications of Low SNR on Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) Accuracy

The reliability of any dynamic spectrum enforcement mechanism hinges on its ability to classify the type of transmission—a task that becomes exponentially harder as SNR degrades. Academic research confirms that when a signal's SNR decreases, critical identifying characteristics, such as the signal's phase change points, are masked by noise.7 This masking effect severely compromises the fundamental function of modulation classifiers.

Even advanced deep learning-based AMC models, specifically engineered to address the performance imbalance between low-SNR and high-SNR scenarios using complex Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, demonstrate significant limitations. Experiments utilizing the MoE-AMC framework, which leverages separate models optimized for low and high SNR, achieved an average classification accuracy of only $\mathbf{(71.76\%)}$ across diverse SNR levels in laboratory-standard datasets.3 An accuracy rate of approximately $\mathbf{72\%}$ for state-of-the-art systems highlights the profound technical difficulty of reliable signal classification in contested spectrum. In the real-world, complex, uncontrolled environment of rural Uganda—where legitimate signals hover near the $\mathbf{(-90~dBm)}$ threshold—the actual classification accuracy of DAE systems attempting to identify illegal signals is highly likely to be much lower. The inability to correctly classify the modulation type invalidates evidence necessary for enforcement, underscoring the necessity for robust AMC systems specifically trained and calibrated for the challenging Ugandan channel characteristics.

Furthermore, regional studies confirm the volatility of the operational environment. Performance analysis of TV White Space (TVWS) radios in South Africa, deployed in underserved rural areas sharing similar spectral goals with UCUSAF projects, showed varying effectiveness across different standards (IEEE 802.11af performing better than 3GPP LTE-A) in metrics like Spectrum Utilisation Efficiency (SUE) and Received Signal Strength (RSS).8 This differential performance among rural access technologies confirms that DAE/AMC platforms must be technologically agnostic and capable of adapting their detection algorithms to various expected modulation schemes (e.g., 802.11af for local networks or 3GPP standards for cellular), necessitating the computational flexibility inherent in Software Defined Radio (SDR) and AI-enabled platforms.10

### C. Critical Data Gap Highlight: Missing Direct Rural SNR/BER Measurements

Despite the acknowledged importance of studying wireless channel behavior in rural settings globally 12, and significant local initiatives like UCUSAF 2, a substantial gap exists in the public domain. There is a critical absence of recent (2018–present) empirical, field-measured data quantifying the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) or Bit Error Rate (BER) specifically within rural Ugandan deployments.13

This absence of quantitative channel data severely hampers the UCC's ability to conduct precise regulatory impact modeling. Regulators cannot accurately determine, for instance, the exact increase in BER or the corresponding drop in throughput caused by a specific illegal transmission power. Consequently, regulatory enforcement is often forced to rely on generalized propagation models or operator-reported, high-level Quality of Service (QoS) metrics (such as call drop rates) rather than definitive, spectral evidence. The immediate deployment of an AMC/DAE-enabled monitoring network would serve a dual purpose: enabling real-time enforcement while simultaneously filling this persistent regulatory data gap, providing the necessary ground truth for evidence-based spectrum policy moving forward.

## III. Operational Vulnerabilities: Documented Service Impacts and Enforcement Failures

The technical fragility of the low-SNR environment directly translates into operational risks for critical national services and undermines the regulator's ability to enforce QoS standards.

### A. Critical Infrastructure Risk: Aviation Warnings and GNSS Interference

While historical aviation incidents in Uganda have been linked to other factors 15, the escalating global threat of spectrum interference requires a proactive domestic response, particularly concerning critical safety systems. International aviation bodies, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), have identified Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)—specifically deliberate jamming and spoofing—as an escalating, persistent critical safety threat to global civil aviation operations.17

Modern civil aviation relies heavily on GNSS for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) data, which is essential for systems such as precision approaches, efficient en-route navigation, automated air traffic management, and flight management computers.17 Unauthorized transmissions that deliberately mimic or override legitimate GNSS signals (spoofing) pose an extreme threat. Detecting these sophisticated attacks requires advanced AMC capabilities to distinguish the malicious signal from the legitimate PNT transmissions, followed by DAE to rapidly geo-locate and neutralize the source. Given Uganda's position as a regional air transport hub, this global threat is highly relevant and necessitates the deployment of DAE capabilities to secure PNT integrity, directly addressing infrastructure security mandates under the NDPIII.1 Furthermore, any monitoring system based on Software Defined Radios (SDR) used for tactical communications must be capable of handling intense signal competition and interference without human intervention 11; failure to accurately classify the modulation of a sophisticated interference signal can lead to catastrophic enforcement failure.

### B. Regulatory Failure Proxies: Compromised Quality of Service (QoS) Enforcement

The Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) ensures consumer protection by strictly monitoring and enforcing key quality indicators, including call drop rates, network availability, and data speeds.18 A crucial mandate requires operators to deliver rapid fault resolution: $\mathbf{(95\%)}$ of all reported faults must be repaired within $\mathbf{(24~hours)}$.4

However, when network performance issues—such as high call drop rates or slow data throughput—are caused by illegal, intermittent, or difficult-to-classify external spectrum interference, MNOs often find it impossible to meet these strict timelines. A fault resulting from an unclassified illegal transmission presents an operational dilemma; without the capability for AMC-driven spectrum forensics to definitively identify the external signal source, modulation type, and its geographic location within the first few hours, the MNO cannot "repair" the network fault, inevitably leading to a breach of the UCC's mandated $\mathbf{(24-hour)}$ repair requirement.4 DAE is thus essential, providing the automatic classification and geo-location data necessary for rapid, evidence-based compliance and service restoration.

### C. Enforcement Challenges and Misclassification Risk

A primary objective of Uganda's Proposed Spectrum Management Policy is "To improve the transparency and effectiveness of the spectrum management process".6 Effective and transparent enforcement is paramount to achieving this goal.

Traditional spectrum enforcement focuses primarily on identifying the location and power level of an unauthorized signal. However, in the low-SNR environment, if the signal's modulation remains unclassified or is misclassified due to high noise 7, it becomes technically impossible to determine the signal's true nature—whether it is malicious interference (like a jammer), an intentional illegal broadcast, or merely a legitimate signal from a nearby licensed user that is operating outside its authorized power parameters. The high misclassification potential demonstrated by technical benchmarks ($\mathbf{71.76\%}$ accuracy 3) prevents regulators from building a conclusive case. AMC provides the necessary technical layer to extract the modulation fingerprint, converting a vague interference report into definitive spectral intelligence required for issuing precise regulatory warnings or pursuing successful prosecution. This forensic capability directly supports the "effectiveness" objective articulated in the national Spectrum Management Policy.6

## IV. Regulatory Alignment: Policy Justification for Advanced Spectrum Tools

The need for advanced spectrum monitoring and enforcement is intrinsically linked to Uganda's overarching national development goals, demonstrating that AMC and DAE are technical prerequisites for fulfilling major policy mandates.

### A. National Development Plan III (NDPIII) and Digital Transformation Mandates

The Digital Transformation Programme (Programme 10) within the NDPIII mandates a focus on the "Deployment of secure, integrated and cross sector infrastructure" and the crucial "Enhancement of national cyber security".1 Spectrum resilience constitutes a foundational element of national cyber security, as the communications backbone is vulnerable to radio frequency attacks, jamming, and denial-of-service via interference.

DAE systems, by proactively classifying and mitigating radio frequency threats, function as a critical physical layer security component, ensuring the communications infrastructure remains operational and contributing directly to the NDPIII's core theme of "Industrialization for Job creation and Shared Prosperity".1 Furthermore, national discussions regarding the use of AI and IoT to build resilient rural communication networks have identified implementation challenges, including "infrastructure limitations".14 Spectral interference is a fundamental infrastructure limitation that reduces effective capacity and reliability. AI-enabled solutions like AMC/DAE, which use machine learning for real-time classification and predictive optimization, are the exact technological instruments required to overcome these spectral limitations and achieve the resilience sought by policymakers and researchers.14

### B. Quantified Targets within the National Broadband Policy (NBP)

The National Broadband Strategy set ambitious targets aimed at transforming the economy through connectivity. Key goals included achieving minimum broadband speeds of $\mathbf{(3~Mbps)}$ by 2020 and attaining rural broadband access penetration of $\mathbf{(50\%)}$ by 2020.5

Achieving a reliable throughput of $\mathbf{3~Mbps}$ mandates that MNOs utilize spectral-efficient, high-order modulation schemes (such as 64-QAM), which critically depend on maintaining a high, stable SNR environment. Given that many rural deployments operate at the UCC's marginal threshold ($\text{RSRP} > -90~\text{dBm}$) 2, the margin for interference is extremely small. Uncontrolled interference rapidly forces the system to perform rate adaptation, falling back to lower-order, less spectrum-efficient modulations (like QPSK), which instantly drops user throughput below the mandated $\mathbf{(3~Mbps)}$ target.5 DAE is thus required to proactively clear the spectrum, sustain the high SNR necessary for stable high-order modulation, and ultimately ensure the success of the NBP's quantified speed and access goals.

### C. Uganda's Spectrum Policy and the Mandate for Dynamic Access

Uganda's Proposed Spectrum Management Policy provides explicit top-level justification for investment in advanced spectral tools, stating the objective "To encourage the investment in and use of spectrum efficient technologies and techniques".6

This efficiency directive aligns with broader policy discussions recognizing the limitations of static spectrum allocation. Overcoming these limitations requires a shift toward dynamic spectrum distribution mechanisms, often facilitated by cognitive radio networks.19 Cognitive Radio (CR) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) are widely recognized as the epitome of "spectrum efficient technologies." CR relies fundamentally on precise, real-time spectrum sensing, which is the core technical function provided by AMC. DAE represents the regulatory and operational implementation of DSA, ensuring that newly introduced secondary users or opportunistic services (like TVWS 8) utilize the spectrum without causing harmful interference to primary license holders. Therefore, the adoption of AMC and DAE constitutes the necessary technological translation of Uganda's stated policy mandate toward dynamic and highly efficient spectrum management.19

## V. Engineering Solution: The Role of AMC and DAE in Spectrum Resilience

The confluence of low-SNR operational environments, high-stakes infrastructure risks, and ambitious policy mandates dictates that spectrum management must transition from reactive monitoring to proactive, intelligent enforcement.

### A. AMC: Real-Time Signal Intelligence in Challenged Channels

AMC systems, particularly those leveraging machine learning and deep learning models optimized for difficult conditions (such as the MoE framework demonstrating $\mathbf{71.76\%}$ accuracy 3), offer the most viable path to robust signal identification in Uganda's low-SNR channels, which are defined by the UCC's $\mathbf{(-90~dBm)}$ threshold.2 AMC systems move beyond simple power detection to identify the complex, unique fingerprint of a transmission, converting raw radio frequency data into actionable intelligence (modulation type, bandwidth, symbol rate).

This capability is essential for modern spectrum forensic analysis, allowing regulators to reliably distinguish between accidental spectral leakage, legitimate but misaligned transmissions, and sophisticated malicious jamming or spoofing (e.g., targeting critical GNSS services 17). The detailed forensic output provided by AMC is the technical foundation upon which effective DAE action must be built.

### B. DAE: Automated Enforcement and Regulatory Compliance

DAE systems provide continuous, automated spectrum surveillance, utilizing AMC classification data to define and attribute interference events.

When a localized network fault occurs—such as an inexplicable spike in call drop rates—DAE can provide immediate, automated evidence that the fault was caused by external spectrum contamination (i.e., an unclassified or illegal signal) rather than attributable to operator network error. This capability allows MNOs to validate the source of the disruption quickly, enabling them to meet the UCC's mandated $\mathbf{(24-hour)}$ repair targets 4 by addressing the interference source directly. Crucially, DAE ensures that strategic investments made through UCUSAF to expand coverage in unserved areas 2 are protected. By dynamically mitigating interference, DAE guarantees that new tower sites can maintain high spectral efficiency and signal quality, maximizing the coverage and reliable service delivered from each strategically placed mast.

## VI. Synthesis of Findings and Strategic Recommendations

The analysis confirms a critical misalignment between Uganda's ambitious policy goals for digital inclusion and the current technical limitations of spectrum governance in a challenging low-SNR environment. The necessity for AMC and DAE is quantitative, operational, and regulatory, serving to bridge the gap between mandated coverage (signal strength $\mathbf{> -90~dBm}$) and mandated quality ($\mathbf{3~Mbps}$ throughput and $\mathbf{24-hour}$ fault resolution).

A critical finding is the absence of publicly available, Uganda-specific empirical measurements (SNR, BER, or classifier accuracy) for rural wireless channels (e.g., UCUSAF projects) post-2018. This data gap necessitates reliance on technical proxies (like the $\mathbf{(-90~dBm)}$ RSRP threshold 2 and global AMC benchmarks 3), which further underscore the vulnerability of the system and justify immediate investment in intelligent, data-gathering enforcement infrastructure.

The following table summarizes the strategic case for deploying AMC and DAE systems.

Strategic Recommendation: The Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) must prioritize the procurement and deployment of a nationwide, AMC-enabled Software Defined Radio (SDR) monitoring network capable of automated, Dynamic Spectrum Enforcement (DAE). This infrastructure investment is the critical missing link required to transition from static, reactive regulation to dynamic, proactive spectrum governance. Such a system will secure the spectral environment, protect UCUSAF infrastructure investments, ensure compliance with national QoS mandates, and provide the empirical data necessary for future evidence-based spectrum policy, thereby safeguarding Uganda's path toward digital transformation.
