The quarter ending June 2023 saw the conclusion of the 13th Communications Consumer Parliament 
(CCP-13) that was held in Kamuli. The event that was preceded by week-long consumer empowerment 
activities in the Busoga sub-region conducted in the districts of Kamuli, Iganga, Luuka and Jinja included 
consumer health camps, a youth in ICT seminar, a cybersecurity challenge, and radio talk-shows,  with 
an audience of 200 people and a total reach of 10,000 people across the 9 days. 
The CCP and associated consumer empowerment activities are geared towards the delivery of consumer 
education on fraud, device verification, and consumer self-help tips; strengthening dialogue between 
consumers, service providers and regulators; and addressing consumer issues arising from UCC’s 
feedback channels (surveys, outreach activity reports, call centre). This initiative seeks to facilitate 
multi-stakeholder engagement by bringing together regulators, service providers and consumers to 
discuss pressing communication issues.

In the quarter ending June 2023, UCUSAF undertook digital literacy skilling for women in underserved 
communities. This was done in partnership with Women in Technology Uganda (WITU). The goal 
of this ongoing project is to close the gender gap in ICT and contribute to the attainment of the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals 2030.
 
The project aims to impart basic digital skills on 3,000 women in the informal sector across the 20 
priority districts, with at least 150 women trained in each district. As of June 2023, digital skills 
enhancements have been conducted in all the 20 districts with a total of  3,271 women beneficiaries.
 
In addition, UCUSAF in conjunction with the Federation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises 
Uganda undertook a series of week-long trainings targeting micro, small and medium-sized enterprises 
in Kanungu and Moroto districts. The training targeted informal small business owners in specific 
sectors (tailoring, welding, motor vehicle mechanics, hairdressing etc). The training exercise equipped 
1,130 people with ICT skills in Moroto, Iganga, Tororo and Kanungu.

Service Access and 
Subscriptions 
14
June 2023 - Market Performance Report2.1. Telephone Subscriptions 
In the months April to June 2023, fixed and mobile subscriptions grew by 600,000 new subscriptions. 
This brings the total number of telephone subscriptions to 34.9 million  at the end of June 2023, from 
34.3 million in March 2023. 
This growth is predominantly mobile telephone subscriptions that accounted for 595,000 new 
subscriptions.  
Unique Mobile Subscriptions
In terms of unique service access, the count of unique SIM subscriptions stands at 13.3 million.  This 
leads to a national ratio of National Identity Number (NIN) Card per subscription to 1:3, this means that 
each national ID is attached to 3 SIM cards. 
The growth in subscriptions translates into a national telephone penetration of 77 lines for every 
100 Ugandans. In unique SIM count terms, the penetration comes down to 58 lines for every 100 
Ugandans for the ages above 15 years of age from the latest population estimate from the Uganda 
Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). 
NB: This is based on the number of GSM subscriptions/total population.
15
June 2023 - Market Performance Report2.2. Devices and Terminals 
In the 3 months ending June 2023, the market posted a total of 40 million gadgets on the network. 
This is a 3% in comparison to the 39 million that were posted in 1Q23. Of the 1 million new device 
additions , 634,000 were smart, 58,000 were basic gadgets whereas 383,000 were feature phones. 
The growth in smart phones could be attributed to the affordability and accessibility of smartphones 
compared to other internet-enabled devices. Furthermore, active 90-day mobile internet subscriptions 
account for 94% of the 13.3million smart phones on the network at the end of June 2023.
The market reflects a growing mobile internet dependency as well as an environment conducive to the 
delivery and adoption of various digital services, such as mobile apps, online transactions, and content 
consumption.
The prevailing smartphone adoption trends underscore the popularity of these devices, even in the 
face of a substantial 49% tax burden. Engaging in discussions aimed at revising downward the existing 
tax policies on these devices becomes imperative. The revisions hold the potential to narrow ICT 
access disparities, fostering increased adoption and utilization of ICT  services.
By doing so, not only can this contribute to elevated government revenue through enhanced ICT usage, 
but it may also mitigate the current revenue losses attributed to the high tax imposed on handsets. This 
strategic approach aligns with the dual objectives of enhancing digital inclusion and optimizing fiscal 
considerations in the telecommunications sector.Consistent with the performance of the last 3 years, 2Q22 saw the biggest jump in year-on-year 
additions in fixed and mobile telephony. The telephone subscriptions count has grown by 3.5 million 
new connections since June 2022. 
Feature Phones

2.3. Internet Subscriptions  
Active 90 Day Mobile Internet Subscriptions
In the three months ending June 2023, the market witnessed a 6% surge in active 90-day mobile 
internet subscriptions, reaching 12.5 million  from 11.8 million at the end of March 2023. This indicates 
that mobile internet is the primary driver, constituting 45 out of every 100 internet connections with a 
minimum of 90 days of activity.
In aggregate terms, this elevates the total internet connections to 27.7 million  subscriptions, up from 
27 million in March 2023. In terms of penetration, the 27.7 million internet subscriptions result in an 
internet national penetration rate of 61 connections for every 100 Ugandans.
 
The predominant force fuelling internet adoption in the country remains the proliferation of smartphones, 
accounting for 99% of the total new connections across both mobile phones and other mobile internet 
devices.
 
On a year-on-year comparison, the twelve months ending June 2023 saw an increase of 4 million new 
internet subscriptions from 23.7 million in 1Q22, marking the highest year-on-year growth at 17% in 
internet subscriptions..
Smartphone proliferation continues to 
be the main driver of internet adoption 
in the country with 99% of the total new 
connections attached to both mobile 
phones as well as other mobile internet 
devices. 
On a year-on-year comparison, the 
twelve months that ended June 2023 
recorded  4 million new internet 
subscriptions from 23.7 million in 
1Q22. This presents the highest yet 
year-on year growth of 17% in internet 
subscriptions. 
2.4. Mobile and Electronic Money Subscriptions
At the end of June 2023, the number of registered mobile money accounts had risen to 39.4 million 
from 38.1 million at the end of March 2023. This is a net addition of 1.3 million new registered mobile 
money accounts in the 3 months April to June 2023. NB: These numbers are based on the total number of subscriptions that use above 5MBs of data a 
month. 

17
June 2023 - Market Performance ReportIn mobile money activity terms, the 90-
day active accounts have grown by 
265,000  accounts. The active 90-day 
accounts stand at 26.5 million accounts 
as of June 2023. Relatedly, the number 
of mobile money access points has grown 
by 132,000 new points in the months 
April to June 2023. This translates into an 
agent activity ratio of 57 agents for every 
parish, and 8 agents per village.
The expansion of mobile money agents 
can be attributed, in part, to the rising trend 
of incorporating mobile money services 
into the operations of bank agents who 
were previously operating independently. 
These agents now serve dual roles, acting 
as both traditional bank representatives 
and mobile money service providers.
On a year-on-year comparison, a total of 4.7 million  new mobile money accounts were registered in 
the 12 months ended June 2023. The number of mobile money accounts translates into a national 
penetration of 8 mobile money accounts for every 10 Ugandans.

Traffic and Usage 
19
June 2023 - Market Performance Report3.1.	 Domestic	Voice	Traffic	
17.3 billion minutes of domestic traffic were posted in the three months April to June 2023. This is a 
combination of both on-net and off-net domestic traffic in the country . 
In the offnet minute segment, the industry posted a record 251 million minutes of talk time which is a 
27% spike in voice traffic exchanges between different operators. This is against the backdrop of the 
198 million minutes that was recorded at the end of March 2023. 
The surge in offnet traffic emerges from the disincentive to switch to other network SIM cards due to 
the existence of all net bundles.
In network-to-network voice traffic terms, the industry maintained a total of 17 billion minutes of domestic 
talk time in comparison to March 2023. 
3.2.	 Internet	Traffic	
In the period April to June 2023, the sector recorded total internet traffic of 154.6 billion GBs 
(downloaded or uploaded) from the internet. This is a 16 billion GBs growth from the 138.5 billion GBs 
posted in 1Q23.  This is 12% quarter on quarter traffic growth from the 7% growth as compared to the 
previous period. 
Mobile internet traffic posted a 13% growth with a quarter end count of 144.5 billion GBs in comparison 
to the 128.4 billion GBs that was posted in the previous quarter. The continued adoption of affordable 
and non-expiry data bundles in the industry contribute to this growth. In the fixed internet traffic segment, 
the market maintained a quarterly growth of 10 billion GBs.
In year-on-year comparisons, mobile internet constitutes a substantial 95% of the observed growth in 
internet traffic. During the three months ending June 2023, mobile internet traffic surged by 47 million 
GBs, significantly outpacing the 2.5 million GBs growth observed in fixed internet traffic compared to 
the same quarter in June 2022.On a year-on-year comparison, the offnet domestic traffic has grown 1.7 times with a jump of 107 million 
minutes in traffic growth between June 2022 and June 2023. In percentage terms, this represents a 
75% growth in domestic traffic between the two quarters. 
This is 3 times more than the growth observed in the on-net domestic talk time of only 6% observed 
between June 2022 and June 2023. 

20
June 2023 - Market Performance Report
3.2.	 One	Network	 Area	Voice	Traffic	
The period 2Q23 posted 288 million minutes of total One Network Area (ONA) voice traffic. 
In ONA incoming voice traffic terms, the sector posted a count of 261.6 million minutes, with a net 
positive increase of 9% in comparison to the 240.7 million minutes at the end of the quarter ending 
March 2023. The increase in traffic is attributed to organic growth associated with business movements 
specifically in the ONA partnership states of Kenya, Rwanda and South Sudan. 
Worth noting is the fact that while ONA incoming traffic rose by 20.9 million minutes in the quarter, total 
international incoming traffic dipped by 8.5 million minutes during the same period. Uganda remains 
an ONA net traffic receiver as incoming ONA traffic is now 10 times more than outgoing ONA traffic. 
ONA outgoing traffic shrunk from 35.2 million minutes in March 2023 to 26.7 million minutes in June 
2023. This represents a 24% drop. 
In comparison to the quarter ending June 2022, total ONA traffic has grown from 232.5 million minutes 
to a tune of 288 million at the end of June 2023. This is a 24% increase in ONA voice traffic. 

21
June 2023 - Market Performance Report3.3.	 International	Voice	Traffic	
In the quarter under review, the international incoming voice traffic segment dipped with a total quarterly 
count of 18.5 million minutes. A net drop of 944,000 minutes was recorded in the three months ending 
June 2023, from the 19.4 million minutes of incoming international talk time recorded at the end of the 
three months ending March 2023.
In International outgoing voice traffic terms, the sector posted a 1.7 million voice traffic dip from the 10.3 
million minutes observed in international outgoing voice traffic in 1Q23 to the 8.6 million  recorded at 
the quarter ending June 2023. 
The decline in international voice traffic during the June quarter might be influenced by seasonal 
factors, with individuals tending to travel more internationally in the summer, potentially resulting in 
fewer international calls. The decrease in international voice calls could be linked to the price elasticity 
related to the expenses of international roaming charges, encouraging individuals to opt for VoIP 
(Voice-over-Internet-Protocol) calls through platforms like WhatsApp.
3.4. Mobile Money Transactions  
By the end of June 2023, the industry recorded 1.62 billion mobile money transactions, up from 1.44 
billion transactions at the end of March 2023. This represents a 13% quarter on quarter growth, the first 
double digit growth in the industry since October 2021. 
The growth in mobile money transactions could be attributed to the spike in service payments such as 
school fees associated with the resumption of the schooling term particularly in the months of May - 
June 2023 as well as Person to Person transactions like Person (P2P) transfers, utility and merchant 
payments. 

22

3.5.	 USSD	Traffic	
On the back of strong performance of the mobile financial service business, the sector posted 11.5 
billion sessions by the end of June 2023, from 10.7 billion sessions by the end of the three months 
ending March 2023. This is growth by a factor of 15%. 
The total number of sessions averaged 3.8 billion per month during the quarter. The quarterly peak 
was realised in May 2023 with a total of 4.1 billion USSD sessions. In year-on-year terms, the industry 
recorded a 24% growth in sessions from the 9.3 billion sessions in the quarter ending 2022.

In the 3 months ending June 2023, the industry posted UGX 1.37 trillion in comparison to the UGX 
1.34 trillion that was posted at the end of March 2023.

of the growth followed by data services at 24% and tower lease at 17%. Other services such as retail 
and input/wholesale revenues like International Bandwidth, Value Added Services account for 24% of 
the growth. It is worth noting that this growth does not include Mobile Money Services.

sending remittances to their families in Uganda. This program involves the introduction of cost-effective 
stamps, with prices ranging from UGX 2,000 to UGX 10,000.
This innovative approach benefits Ugandans residing in rural areas by providing them with quick and 
affordable access to their remittances, costing only 3% of the total remittance amount. This move 
serves to promote financial inclusion, particularly among rural and marginalized communities.

189,743 mails compared to the previous quarter’s 188,625 mails ending in March 2023. This growth 
was primarily driven by enhanced licensing and reporting compliance. 
Further, the entrance of new licensees into the courier market, responding to the heightened demand for 
door-to-door delivery services by domestic e-commerce businesses, played a pivotal role in boosting 
domestic mail volumes.

6.1.2 Active Pay TV Subscriptions
Between March 2023 and June 2023, the total count of active 
pay TV subscribers decreased from 2.4 million to 1.6 million . 
This retention in subscription numbers underscores the 
crucial role of international sports content among Ugandan 
subscribers such as the English Football premier league.
It’s noteworthy that the observed decline in subscriptions 
prompted content broadcasters to introduce new product 
offerings and discounted packages in response to evolving 
subscriber preferences.
