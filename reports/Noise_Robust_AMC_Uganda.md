The Necessity of Noise-Robust Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) in Uganda’s Digital EconomyExecutive Summary: The Digital Imperative and RF Resilience in Uganda (2018–2024)Uganda is navigating a critical phase of digital transformation, characterized by rapid adoption of mobile services that severely pressures existing spectrum infrastructure. The analysis presented here quantifies the pervasive challenges—high spectral congestion in urban areas, vast coverage deficits in rural regions, and acute national security requirements for signal integrity—and concludes that conventional static spectrum management is unsustainable. The core imbalance stems from high mobile data consumption, evidenced by the increase to 16 million mobile internet users in 2023 1, straining a limited high-speed infrastructure where only 31% of the country has 4G coverage.1 This forces much of the operational environment into low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and complex propagation regimes.The Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) mandate for "optimal utilization" of spectrum 2 and the ongoing enforcement against illicit transmissions impacting critical national services, such as aviation 3, establish an urgent requirement for sophisticated RF monitoring. This report demonstrates that the required technical resilience is achievable through the deployment of Software-Defined Radio (SDR) systems augmented by noise-robust Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) and Deep Autoencoder (DAE) denoisers. Academic research confirms that DAE integration can deliver up to a 70% increase in classification accuracy at low SNR.4 This technological upgrade is essential for extending service reliability to the majority of the population operating under adverse conditions and for strengthening national security surveillance capabilities against covert or malicious RF activity.I. Quantification of Spectrum Congestion and Regulatory DynamicsThe economic and social development agenda in Uganda, particularly the objectives laid out in the National Development Plan III (2020/21 – 2024/25), relies heavily on increasing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) penetration and use.5 However, this growth has placed intense, quantifiable pressure on the finite radio frequency spectrum, necessitating a regulatory pivot toward dynamic spectrum management (DSM).I.A. Mobile Data Traffic and Spectral Saturation MetricsUganda has witnessed sustained, high-volume growth in telecommunications use across the population. Recent statistics from the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) confirm a robust addressable market. The country has reached 33.2 million total mobile subscriptions and recorded 23.7 million broadband connections.6 Most critically, the number of mobile internet subscribers has increased steadily from 14 million in 2020 to 16 million in 2023.1 This growth rate, representing a 14.3% increase in mobile internet usage over three years, underscores the intense and growing demand for digital capacity.This dramatic increase in demand directly confronts a fundamental physical limitation: the spectrum is, by definition, a "limited resource".2 Recognizing this constraint, the UCC, which holds the mandate to allocate and oversee spectrum utilization 7, has made "optimal utilization of assigned radio frequency spectrum" and "efficient use" 2 its primary regulatory objectives. This focus on efficiency is a direct consequence of quantified market pressure. Since the physical spectrum cannot be expanded to match the growth in data consumption, regulators are compelled to mandate, facilitate, and eventually enforce technologies that extract the utmost social-economic benefit from the existing bandwidth.2 This regulatory environment provides the strongest possible justification for investing in Cognitive Radio (CR) technologies that promise efficiency gains through Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA).Further compounding the issue is the infrastructure bottleneck. Although subscription rates are high, only 31% of the country has access to 4G service.1 This disparity concentrates high-speed data users within a severely limited geographic footprint, leading to predictable spatial and temporal congestion peaks in urban and peri-urban centers. This high signal density necessitates extremely accurate spectrum sensing and interference avoidance capabilities, even among licensed operators, to manage spectrum overlap and complex co-existence environments.9I.B. The Cognitive Radio Imperative and Modulation RecognitionCognitive radio (CR) is universally recognized as the technological architecture required to address spectral saturation in the presence of continuous market growth.10 Defined as an enhancement to Software-Defined Radio (SDR), CR enables the transceiver to automatically detect and smartly accommodate its operating parameters to the network infrastructure, thereby enabling Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA).10The functional cornerstone of any CR system is Spectrum Sensing, the ability to accurately and reliably identify unutilized frequency bands—often referred to as "spectrum holes"—without causing detrimental interference to licensed (Primary) users (PUs).10 Within this process, Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is the critical intermediary technology. AMC determines what the detected signal is (e.g., BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, or an unauthorized FM transmission).13 The CR then uses this classification information to decide on the safest and most efficient subsequent action, whether that is altering its transmission power, changing its modulation scheme, or moving to a different spectrum band (Spectrum Mobility and Sharing).10 Without reliable AMC, especially under low-power or noisy conditions, the entire DSA paradigm collapses, as the system risks causing interference, thereby violating the UCC's core regulatory objective of optimal utilization.2II. Analyzing Rural Connectivity Gaps and Physical Environment ConstraintsWhile congestion dominates urban concerns, the defining challenge for Uganda's broader digital economy remains the vast geographic and demographic gap in rural connectivity. This deficit translates directly into operational environments characterized by hostile RF propagation conditions: pervasive low-SNR and severe multipath effects.II.A. Quantification of Geographic and Infrastructure GapsThe infrastructure statistics highlight a profound digital divide. Only 31% of the country is covered by 4G service 1, forcing the vast majority of users who are outside this zone to rely on less efficient standards, evidenced by the 77% 3G coverage statistic.1 This lack of high-speed coverage is compounded by deficiencies in backhaul infrastructure. The National Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) spans 4,300 km and connects major cities, but it covers only 53 of the 146 districts, representing just 36% geographic coverage.1 This substantial 64% deficit in high-capacity fiber backhaul severely limits the potential for upgrading wireless services in remote areas.The functional impact of this gap is reinforced by regional data. The ITU reports that in Africa, the urban-rural internet use gap is quantified by a ratio of 2.5.15 This means urban dwellers are 2.5 times more likely to use the internet than rural dwellers. Such extreme disparity confirms that service delivery outside major urban centers is exceptionally challenging and unreliable.The operational consequence of this infrastructure deficit is the establishment of persistent, long-term low-SNR regimes across the majority of Uganda's rural RF environment. Remote base stations, lacking fiber backhaul and forced to rely on wireless links, must serve users at far greater distances, pushing user equipment deep into the cell edge. In these conditions, traditional AMC and spectrum sensing algorithms exhibit severe performance degradation.4 Furthermore, Uganda’s varied topography—including hills, vegetation, and localized urban density—creates significant multipath fading and shadowing. Multipath is a non-linear source of error known to cause large, non-Gaussian fluctuations in signal reception.17 These non-linear distortions are exacerbated at low SNR 19, fundamentally corrupting the phase and amplitude features that conventional classifiers rely upon for accurate modulation identification.II.B. Alternative Access Strategies and CR Requirements (TVWS)To address the need for broadband access in low-density rural areas, the UCC has strategically endorsed the development of alternative technologies, notably the use of TV White Space (TVWS) spectrum in the 470 to 694 MHz UHF band.5 TVWS utilizes temporarily unused spectrum bands (spectrum holes) belonging to incumbent TV broadcasters, making it a critical form of DSA.Implementing TVWS successfully requires extremely robust and reliable spectrum sensing over long propagation distances—a necessity given the lower frequencies involved and the wide geographic coverage intended.5 This operational mode inherently places sensing systems in the challenging, low-SNR environments characteristic of rural Uganda. The margin for error is minimal, as false positives could cause interference with licensed TV broadcasters, and false negatives would lead to wasted spectral opportunities. Therefore, the strategic push for TVWS infrastructure deployment directly mandates the use of highly accurate, noise-robust AMC technology to ensure effective, non-interfering spectrum co-existence.III. Strategic RF Security Monitoring and Threat MitigationIn addition to economic and social connectivity goals, the integrity of the electromagnetic spectrum is a matter of critical national security and public safety. Advanced RF monitoring, detection, and classification capabilities are indispensable for maintaining order and defending against malicious use of the spectrum.III.A. National Security Requirements and Illicit TransmissionsThe regulatory authority, the UCC, actively manages threats arising from illicit use of the spectrum. In September 2024, the UCC launched a significant crackdown on illegal and non-compliant broadcasters, emphasizing that these transmissions "affect critical users of frequencies such as aviation and some security services".3 Non-compliance includes operation outside license terms, while illegal operations involve unlicensed transmissions altogether. Such enforcement actions, which include confiscating equipment and prosecuting offenders, confirm an acute, ongoing requirement for pervasive, real-time RF surveillance.Global defense and security institutions recognize that the complexity of the RF spectrum poses new levels of threat, encompassing RF-enabled espionage and cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.20 Protecting these environments necessitates continuous, real-time RF signal detection and analysis, supported by AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms capable of rapid assessment of signal anomalies. The inclusion of defense and security requirements is intrinsically integrated into spectrum policy; the Uganda National Table of Frequency Allocation (NTFA) is periodically revised to align with international standards while fully incorporating national priorities and requirements, including defense mandates.21III.B. The AMC Role in Electronic Warfare (EW) PreparednessThe deployment of noise-robust AMC is essential for enhancing Electronic Warfare (EW) preparedness and technical surveillance countermeasure (TSCM) operations. Security monitoring cannot tolerate reliance on slow, post-demodulation analysis. When an unauthorized or suspicious signal—whether an illegal FM station, a localized jamming signal, or a covert digital link—is detected, immediate, actionable intelligence is required. AMC provides this intelligence by rapidly and accurately classifying the signal's modulation type.The ability to classify a signal, even if weak or transient, expedites the process of identifying the transmitter’s purpose and locating its source, which is critical for time-sensitive security response. This constitutes a cornerstone of modern EW operations. Furthermore, sophisticated security threats, such as those related to espionage or cross-border crime 23, often employ covert transmitters that intentionally operate at low power or use complex, frequency-hopping modulations to evade detection. These threats inherently present a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to distant monitoring stations.Therefore, integrating DAE-enhanced AMC into national monitoring systems is crucial because it significantly extends the effective range and sensitivity of RF monitoring. By maintaining high classification accuracy under adverse, low-SNR conditions where traditional classifiers fail, the system provides a robust defense against sophisticated, low-power, or distant threats, thereby bolstering the nation's Probability of Intercept (PoI).IV. The Technical Solution: Deep Autoencoders (DAE) for Enhanced AMC RobustnessThe quantified challenges in Uganda—spectral congestion demanding DSA, rural coverage gaps characterized by low SNR, and security threats utilizing low-power signals—all converge on the necessity for signal processing that is resilient against noise and complex channel conditions. The technical solution lies in augmenting SDR systems with Deep Learning components, specifically Deep Autoencoders (DAEs) for denoising.IV.A. Degradation of Traditional AMC under Low-SNR/MultipathWhile deep learning (DL) has advanced AMC capability significantly, most current DL-based AMC methods demonstrate limited generalization capability when applied in environments characterized by wildly varying noise conditions, especially at low SNR.4 This limitation makes them unsuitable for direct deployment in demanding operational environments like rural Uganda.Low-SNR and multipath propagation regimes introduce significant signal variability, or intra-class diversity, where the received characteristics of a single modulation type (e.g., 16QAM) vary wildly across time and space. This makes the distinction between spectrally similar, high-order modulations (such as 16QAM and 64QAM) particularly challenging for standard neural networks.13 In a high-congestion environment, failure to accurately distinguish these modulations at low SNR means the CR system cannot reliably utilize the higher-efficiency schemes, severely limiting network capacity.IV.B. Quantifying the Deep Autoencoder (DAE) Performance GainThe solution involves preprocessing the raw RF signal to mitigate the noise and channel effects prior to classification. Deep Autoencoders (DAEs) excel in this role. They function as a non-linear denoiser component, autonomously learning to map the corrupted input signal to a cleaned, latent representation of the signal features.4The quantitative justification for DAE integration is compelling. Research on Threshold Autoencoder Denoiser Convolutional Neural Networks (TADCNN) explicitly demonstrates that incorporating the autoencoder denoiser component improves AMC classification accuracy by up to 70% at low SNR compared with identical models lacking the denoiser.4 Furthermore, hybrid lightweight models that specialize in robust feature extraction (such as TCN-GRU) have shown superior ability in distinguishing challenging modulations like QAM16 and QAM64, improving classification accuracy by approximately 10.5% over older state-of-the-art models in complex and noisy environments.14This 70% performance boost at low SNR has profound strategic implications for spectral efficiency and cost-effective expansion. If a DAE-enhanced SDR can reliably utilize a high-order modulation (e.g., 16QAM) at a specific low-SNR threshold where a non-enhanced system could only support QPSK, the spectral efficiency (bits/Hz/s) is effectively doubled without requiring the massive capital investment of new tower construction or fiber deployment. This makes DAE integration a critical technological lever for achieving cost-effective, sustainable rural broadband expansion, directly supporting the UCC's goals.2Moreover, DAEs overcome physical propagation uncertainty. Multipath creates complex, non-linear distortion that conventional, linear filters cannot effectively model or mitigate.17 By learning a compressed, latent representation that separates the inherent signal features from the propagation-induced noise characteristics, DAEs achieve a level of robustness that is unachievable by traditional spectrum sensing techniques. This non-linear processing capability allows DAE-AMC to reliably classify signals despite the rapid, unpredictable fading and multipath prevalent in Uganda’s challenging terrain.V.

Strategic Roadmap for SDR/AMC+DAE IntegrationTo address the nexus of congestion, connectivity deficits, and security imperatives, a phased strategy focusing on the integration of DAE-enhanced SDR/AMC systems is recommended:Phase 1: National Spectrum Surveillance Upgrade (Security Focus):The immediate priority is to deploy high-sensitivity SDR monitoring stations integrated with DAE-AMC models. This action directly addresses the UCC’s stated requirement to shut down and prosecute illegal operations.3 By utilizing the confirmed low-SNR performance gains (up to 70% accuracy improvement 4), the UCC can significantly enhance its enforcement capabilities, enabling the robust detection and classification of illicit signals that threaten critical national services like aviation and security systems. This mitigates high-priority national security risks immediately.Phase 2: Rural Access Technology Deployment (Efficiency Focus):The second phase involves targeted pilot deployments of CR systems, such as those utilizing TVWS in the 470–694 MHz band 5, or enhanced rural mobile nodes. These deployments must utilize DAE-AMC to dynamically assess and select the highest feasible modulation scheme. This capability optimizes spectral efficiency in the vast majority of the country (the 69% lacking 4G access 1), maximizing throughput in low-SNR environments and ensuring cost-effective expansion. The technical ability to reliably employ higher data rate modulations at the cell edge is the key to closing the significant rural coverage gap.Phase 3: Cognitive Policy and Commercial Integration (Sustainability Focus):The final phase involves transitioning from pilot projects to a national policy framework for sustainable spectrum utilization. This requires the development of regulatory sandbox environments and licensing incentives that explicitly reward operators utilizing CR technologies based on high-reliability (DAE-enhanced) spectrum sensing. This fulfills the UCC’s core mandate of "efficient use" 7 and ensures that the continuous growth in subscriptions (16 million users 1) is supported by an adaptable spectrum management paradigm, reducing the unsustainable reliance on expensive and slow physical infrastructure build-outs (the NBI is only 36% covered 1).VI.
