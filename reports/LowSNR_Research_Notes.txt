Recent Advances in Low-SNR AMC and Denoising
Approaches (2020–2025)
Low-SNR Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) Performance
Abd-Elaziz  et al. , 2023 – “Deep Learning-Based AMC Using Robust CNN Architecture for CR
Networks” (MDPI Sensors ): Proposes a novel CNN with parallel asymmetric convolution blocks and
skip connections to enhance feature extraction at low SNR. Evaluated on a custom dataset of 9
modulation schemes with AWGN, Rician fading, and clock offset impairments, it achieves  86.1%
accuracy at –2 dB SNR , rising to ~99.8% at 10 dB . This substantially outperformed prior CNN-
based  models,  reliably  distinguishing  even  challenging  16QAM/64QAM  in  very  noisy  conditions
(overall average accuracy ~81%). Dataset: Simulated + impairments (non-cooperative scenario).
Zhang  et  al. ,  2023  –  “MoE-AMC:  Mixture-of-Experts  for  AMC”  (arXiv  preprint):  Introduces  a
mixture-of-experts  network that routes signals to different sub-models optimized for high vs. low
SNR. A Transformer-based expert (LSRM) handles low-SNR signals, while a ResNet-based expert
(HSRM) handles high-SNR inputs . A small gating MLP estimates SNR and switches experts
accordingly. On the RML2018.01a  dataset (24 modulations, –20 to 18 dB), MoE-AMC attained 71.76%
average classification accuracy across SNRs – about  10% higher  than prior single-expert CNN or
Transformer  models .  This  demonstrates  balanced  performance:  the  Transformer  branch
preserves accuracy below 0 dB while the ResNet branch excels at higher SNR.
Rehman et al. , 2025 – “DL-AMC: Deep Learning for Automatic Modulation Classification” (arXiv
preprint):  Proposes  converting  raw  I/Q  waveforms  into  eye  diagrams  as  input  to  deep  CNNs
(ResNet-18/50, MobileNet) to boost robustness at low SNR. Trained on a curated set of modulation
types with SNR ranging  –20 dB to 30 dB , the approach achieves  high accuracy even at negative
SNRs , thanks to the noise-resilient eye-diagram representation . For example, at the lowest SNR
in tests, the DL-AMC ResNet substantially outperformed earlier deep models – prior approaches like
DBN, RNN, LSTM, and CLDNN had only ~10–48% accuracy in the lowest-SNR conditions  (near
chance-level), whereas the proposed method maintained strong classification performance. Dataset:
custom-generated signals (multi-SNR) transformed into eye diagrams.
Sathyanarayanan  et al. , 2023 –  IEEE TWC  (“RML22: Realistic Dataset Generation for Wireless
Modulation Classification”):  Introduces the RML22 dataset , a next-generation public dataset that
builds on DeepSig’s RadioML by correcting artifacts in RML2016 data and adding more realistic
channel  effects .  RML22  includes  a  wide  range  of  modulations  (likely  24  classes,  similar  to
RML2018) with improved fidelity to over-the-air conditions. The authors’ data-centric generation
approach yields a benchmark where state-of-the-art models now exceed 99% accuracy at high SNR
, underscoring RML22’s value for evaluating AMC algorithms. This dataset innovation beyond
RadioML 2016/2018 is enabling researchers to validate models under more realistic multipath and
interference  scenarios, bridging the gap between simulation and field performance.•

Jagannath  et al. , 2022 –  PHYCOM  (multi-task AMC on SDR testbed):  Demonstrated a real-world
validation of deep learning AMC on an over-the-air SDR platform . Using a feed-forward CNN-based
multi-task classifier (distinguishing both modulation and signal type), they achieved ≈98% accuracy
on  7  modulation  classes  in  a  live  USRP  testbed  experiment .  This  near-perfect  accuracy  in
controlled OTA tests (moderate SNR) highlights that modern DL models can retain high performance
outside  simulations.  It  also  underscores  the  importance  of  heterogeneous  training  (including
impairments and hardware effects) to ensure models generalize to field conditions. Dataset:  Live OTA
captures via USRP; results confirm consistency with simulation benchmarks.
Denoising Front-Ends and Noise-Robust Techniques for AMC
An & Lee, 2023 – “Robust AMC in Low SNR” (IEEE Access ): Develops a noise-mitigation front-end
consisting of a Thresholded Autoencoder Denoiser (TAD)  and an SNR predictor , integrated before
an AMC classifier . The lightweight SNR estimator triggers the denoiser only for low-SNR inputs,
avoiding  unnecessary  processing  for  high-SNR  signals.  This  design  yielded  a  ~70%  relative
improvement in low-SNR classification accuracy  (vs. no denoiser) . In other words, the TAD
front-end dramatically boosted accuracy in heavy noise scenarios (e.g. from ~30% to ~51% on a very
low SNR set). The overall model (TAD + CNN) achieved robust performance down to ~–10 dB SNR,
illustrating  the  effectiveness  of  learned  denoising.  Datasets:  Evaluated  on  RadioML  2016/2018
variants; the approach improved low-SNR accuracy across these benchmarks.
Faysal  et  al. ,  2025  –  “DenoMAE:  A  Multimodal  Denoising  Autoencoder  for  Modulation
Signals”  (arXiv):  Presents  a  denoising  masked  autoencoder  that  treats  noise  as  an  additional
modality  during self-supervised pre-training. DenoMAE is pre-trained to reconstruct clean I/Q signals
and their constellation diagrams from masked, noisy inputs (leveraging both raw waveform and
constellation  image  domains).  After  fine-tuning  for  classification,  this  approach  reached  83.5%
accuracy  on a 10-class modulation task using only 1,000 labeled samples (with 10,000 unlabeled
pre-training samples) . Crucially, it maintains strong generalization at very low SNR: e.g.  77.5%
accuracy at –10 dB , which is a ~22% improvement over the same model without MAE pre-
training. DenoMAE also outperformed prior denoising methods (e.g. CNN-AMC, DL-GRF) by 24–33%
in low-SNR regimes .  Dataset:  Simulated multi-SNR signals (10 modulations); comparisons show
DenoMAE’s efficacy in noise-intensive environments and even on SNR levels lower than seen in
training (extrapolation).
Suman  &  Qu,  2023  –  “Lightweight  AMC  via  Dual-Path  Residual  Shrinkage  Network”  (MDPI
Electronics ): Proposes an efficient CNN-LSTM architecture with an internal  learnable denoising
mechanism .  The  model  uses  deep  residual  shrinkage  blocks  with  garrote  thresholding  to
adaptively  suppress  noise  in  feature  maps.  Despite  only  ~27k  parameters,  it  achieved  ≈62%
average accuracy  on the 24-class RML2018.01a dataset (–20 to 18 dB) , rivaling larger models. An
ablation showed the garrote-based denoiser yields slightly higher low-SNR accuracy than standard
soft-thresholding – about 2.2% better in the –4 to +6 dB SNR range . The network’s maximum
accuracy  at  high  SNR  reaches  ~97–98%,  and  it  degrades  gracefully  as  SNR  drops .  This
demonstrates that clever threshold-based denoising within  the model can boost noise robustness
with  minimal  complexity  overhead  (garrote  added  ~0.6%  FLOPs).  Datasets:  Evaluated  on
RML2016/2018; the method targets edge devices, showing that denoising boosts accuracy without
heavy computation.•

also released code and datasets (e.g. RML22 on GitHub, DenoMAE on GitHub) alongside these works, aiding
reproducibility and further experimentation . Each study highlights a trend toward improving AMC
performance below 0 dB SNR – whether by novel neural architectures or by introducing explicit denoising –
and validates those improvements either on realistic synthetic data or through over-the-air tests. These
contributions collectively advance the reliability of modulation classification in interference-heavy, low-SNR
environments.
