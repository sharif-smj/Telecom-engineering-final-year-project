Low SNR, Interference & Illegal Transmissions in
Uganda’s Wireless Networks
1. Technical Metrics in Uganda/East Africa
Signal Quality at Cell Edges:  Rural and edge-of-network users often operate near the minimum
SNR for connectivity. For example, an LTE link can maintain ~95% throughput at roughly (–1 dB SNR)
using robust QPSK coding, whereas higher-order modulations demand >10 dB SNR . This
means cell-edge devices frequently fall back to low-rate modulation when SNR dips near zero,
limiting data speeds. 
Interference-Driven Errors: Uganda Communications Commission (UCC)  QoS surveys show that
“poor signal quality” (i.e. degraded SNR due to interference) is a leading cause of network failures. In
late 2019, over (70 %) of MTN and Airtel call failures were attributed to in-network interference  (same-
frequency radios causing self-interference), resulting in dropped/blocked calls . By contrast,
Africell and UTL saw more failures from outright coverage gaps , highlighting how noise vs. signal
paucity both impact rural service. 
Modulation Classification Under Noise:  Cognitive radio studies confirm that heavy noise severely
impairs automatic modulation recognition. One report finds even advanced classifiers barely achieve
(~30% accuracy) at extreme low SNR (–20 dB) . In practice, accuracies remain poor until SNR
improves by an order of magnitude – e.g. an 8-PSK signal requires ~8 dB SNR to reach about (90 %
classification accuracy) . This drop-off underscores the challenge of identifying signals under
Uganda’s noisy spectrum conditions. 
Rural Link Performance Figures:  Field trials in the region quantify the impact of distance and
interference on link quality. For instance, a TV White Space pilot in Malawi (UHF band) reported an
average SNR of (~24.7 dB) over a 7.5 km  link, yet throughput was only ~0.42 Mbps with ~118 ms
latency . This modest data rate, despite a healthy SNR, reflects constraints like limited channel
bandwidth and ambient interference in real deployments. Likewise, in Uganda’s high-traffic areas,
UCC observed call block rates spiking to (34 %)+ in towns like Jinja  (vs. a 2% target), correlating
with low signal levels and local interference issues.
2. Documented Service Impacts
Mobile Network Outages & Quality Degradation:  UCC’s investigations have linked illegal
transmitters to service disruptions. In Oct 2024 , UCC revealed that unauthorized 3.5 GHz point-to-
point radios on Kampala rooftops were interfering  with licensed LTE bands (used by MTN/Airtel),
degrading connectivity downtown . An enforcement operation was launched to dismantle ~8
such links causing these disruptions . Earlier , mid-2023 , UCC had similarly shut down dozens of
illicit signal repeaters (“boosters”) after complaints from operators  that these devices were injecting
noise and crippling local cell reception . Several offenders faced prosecution as the
interference was directly undermining mobile voice and data quality in the affected areas. 
Dropped Calls & Data Failures:  High interference translates to tangible user impact in Uganda’s
networks. UCC’s QoS drive tests (Sept–Nov 2019) found call drop and block rates far above•

acceptable levels in multiple regions, largely due to low SNR. Notably, Airtel users in Jinja
experienced a blocked-call rate of 34%  (meaning over one-third of call attempts failed) , while
cities like Lira, Mbale, and Moroto saw 12–15% call blocking – all vastly exceeding the 2% QoS
threshold. UCC traced this to signal interference and congestion causing “degradation in the quality
of the network signal” and has since pressed operators for remedial plans . Such
interference-induced outages also jeopardize services like mobile money  which rely on a stable
mobile network. 
Aviation Communication Risks:  The Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA)  has cautioned that
traditional aeronautical radio channels suffer reliability issues due to coverage gaps and interference .
In Sept 2024, UCAA noted that over oceanic and remote continental airspace “voice/radio
communication is less reliable… due to limited coverage and interference,” which can lead to
miscommunication . To mitigate this safety risk, Uganda adopted a data-link system (text-
based air-ground communication) less vulnerable to noise. The move came after recognizing that
high radio noise floors were impeding clear voice links with pilots, underscoring how illegal
transmissions or ambient RF noise can even impact critical services like aviation and air traffic
control. 
Enforcement and Monitoring Lapses:  Until recently, Ugandan authorities lacked robust spectrum
monitoring, allowing some illegal operators to persist. UCC has since acquired new monitoring
equipment and, in 2024, jointly with police, intensified crackdowns on pirate broadcasters and
unlicensed radios . For example, numerous “bizindaalo” (outdoor megaphone community
radios) were seized for broadcasting without licenses and causing harmful interference  to legitimate
FM stations and even public safety communications . In one sweep, 30+ illegal radio setups
were dismantled nationwide . These incidents illustrate that unregulated transmitters not only
break the law but also degrade the overall RF environment – prompting UCC to invest in continuous
spectrum surveillance to detect and address interference sources in real time.
3. Policy and Regulatory Mandates
Quality of Service & Coverage Goals:  Uganda’s national strategies explicitly prioritize improved
signal quality and interference management as part of expanding broadband. The Third National
Development Plan (NDPIII 2020/21–2024/25)  acknowledges that broadband infrastructure still has
“significant quality of service challenge,” with most rural areas underserved . NDPIII and the 
National Broadband Policy (2018)  set ambitious targets for universal access (e.g. minimum 4 Mbps
countrywide) and call for investments to extend reliable coverage to 100%  of districts. Indeed,
Uganda’s new Digital Transformation Roadmap (2023–2028)  aims for (90 % broadband coverage)
by 2040, stressing “strengthened infrastructure and wider connectivity”  to bridge the urban–rural divide
. These policies create a mandate for regulators and operators to improve SNR at cell edges,
adhere to QoS thresholds, and reduce outages caused by noise or interference. 
Spectrum Management & Interference Mitigation:  Ugandan law and regulations empower UCC
to enforce strict anti-interference measures. The Uganda Communications Act 2013  (Sections 5, 22,
26–27) forbids operating any radio/transmitter without a license or in violation of technical rules.
UCC’s Radio Spectrum Management Guidelines  (2017) explicitly instruct that “Any interference reported
or observed shall be investigated and addressed.”  Offending users face penalties “including fines,
withdrawal of spectrum and other penalties” for unauthorized or non-compliant transmissions .
In practice, this has led UCC to issue public warnings (e.g. in 2021 against unapproved signal
boosters ) and to mount enforcement operations as noted. The Commission also runs an 
Intelligent Network Monitoring System  to continuously sample QoS and detect anomalies ,9

aligning with ITU best practices. In short, Uganda’s regulatory framework mandates proactive
interference monitoring and swift enforcement to protect licensed services’ SNR and bit error rates. 
Dynamic Spectrum Allocation Initiatives:  National policy supports innovative spectrum sharing to
alleviate congestion and noise. The Digital Uganda Vision 2040  and Broadband Policy encourage 
“optimal utilization of spectrum resources”  through technologies like dynamic access . In 2021, UCC
rolled out a TV White Space (TVWS) usage standard  for the 470–694 MHz band – allowing
secondary rural broadband use of vacant TV channels under a geolocation database system .
This framework permits multiple services to share spectrum without interference, reflecting
Uganda’s commitment to modern spectrum management. Similarly, the regulator has discussed
opening unlicensed or lightly-licensed bands for community networks and Wi-Fi offload as long as
devices meet technical parameters to avoid harmful interference . These policy moves
(guided by NDPIII and the Broadband Infrastructure Blueprint) underscore that mitigating
interference is not just reactive; it’s built into Uganda’s future spectrum planning via smarter
allocation and spectrum sharing  mechanisms. 
Mandated QoS and Monitoring:  Uganda’s National Broadband Policy and UCC regulations also set 
quantitative QoS thresholds  that indirectly target interference issues. For mobile networks, UCC
requires <2% call drop/block rates and adequate signal strength in all covered areas . The Quality
of Service Regulations (2019)  define metrics like signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)  and bit error rate (BER)
that operators must meet, and empower UCC to audit performance . For example, UCC’s 2022
public QoS report compared year-on-year data drop rates and signaled that operators must improve
radio signal levels in regions falling short . Furthermore, Uganda’s National Broadband Plan
emphasizes resilience against “signal interference with other licensed operators” , aligning policy
with the need for on-the-ground enforcement. In sum, through a mix of development plans, policies,
and technical standards, Uganda’s government has mandated: (a) expansion of reliable,
interference-free communications nationwide, (b) adoption of dynamic spectrum tools to maximize
SNR and reduce illegal use, and (c) continuous monitoring with penalties to ensure compliance with
interference mitigation and QoS norms.
Data Gaps:  While the above sources give concrete interference cases and some SNR/accuracy figures,
localized  BER  measurements  in  Uganda’s  rural  deployments  remain  scarce  in  public  literature.  For
instance,  no  specific  bit-error-rate  statistics  for  UCUSAF-funded  tower  sites  were  found  in  connected
sources. Future field studies (e.g. drive tests on UCUSAF base stations or SDR spectrum sensing in villages)
may be needed to quantify BER under real interference conditions. Similarly, detailed modulation-classifier
performance data in Uganda’s context are limited – current figures are mostly from lab simulations. These
gaps suggest an opportunity for on-site measurements and trials to further inform  dynamic spectrum
management  and investment in interference mitigation technologies.
