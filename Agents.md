# Project Agents & Rulesets

## Scope
- Primary deliverable: DAE�AMC prototype and documentation grounded in publicly available datasets (e.g., RF Signal Data, RadioML) and Ugandan regulatory context.
- Out of scope: new field measurements (SNR/BER drive tests, UCUSAF tower instrumentation) unless explicitly approved as future work.
- Keep enforcement/coverage references limited to verified sources already collected; cite additional research only after approval.
